    Answers ecosystem-fit and integration queries spanning two or more projects.

    Distinct from CompareAgent: instead of 'which is better?', the question is
    'can these be used together, and how?'  The agent looks for:
      - Explicit cross-project references in docs (does project A mention B?)
      - Shared contributors (active collaboration signal)
      - Compatible languages, interfaces, and data formats
      - Architectural fit from documentation excerpts

    Requires at least two project slugs resolvable from the query.
    Falls back to clarification if fewer than two can be inferred.
